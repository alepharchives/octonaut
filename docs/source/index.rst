Octonaut - Fastest octopus ever.
================================

Octonaut is a C library consisting of several submodules that provide simple,
fast, and well tested solutions to common socket programming tasks.

Being a C99 library writting bindings to other languages is relatively simple.

The goals of octonaut are to provide utilities to develop complex streaming
socket programs that handle numerous tasks in an efficient and reliable manner.
