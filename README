Octonaut is a fast socket server library to use with libev.

The goals of octonaut include.
* Asynchronous DNS lookups.
* Asynchronous abstraction of a protocol for any kind of IO work, though
  sockets is the focus pipes and other simpler forms of IPC that use
  file descriptors should work!
* Asynchronous HTTP/1.1 Server.
* Asynchronous HTTP/1.1 Client.
* Asynchronous Basis for RPC Servers and Clients, perhaps
  with JSON-RPC and MSGPACK-RPC implementations?
* Bindings for several languages, primarily Python though duh!
* Completely tested with unit, functional, and benchmark tests.
* Completely documented with Sphinx (Sphinx Rocks!) *NOT DOXYGEN*

In regards to python bindings, octonaut should include
* An Asynchronous WSGI Container
* Simple way to make psycopg2 "not block", perhaps using its waiting function
  to simply run the ev_loop like a coroutine framework would.


The general reasoning behind Octonaut is simply most frameworks like this are
written in the language they are directed at (python, ruby, etc) instead of
C which tends to make certain operations much slower. C is fast and it'd be
nice to have a fast way of doing the above things in scripting languages.
